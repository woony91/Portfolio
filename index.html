            <p class = "about-me">I love to build structures and renovation projects but 
                    also technology. I went from building my very first 
                    gaming computer to coding my first basketball quiz. I 
                    am a gamer. I am an outdoor enthusiast. I am a dog lover. 
                    But more importantly, I am a web developer.</p>
    
            <p class = "about-me about2">I am currently based out of Philadelphia and have graduated the 
                    Front End Web Development Career Path bootcamp at Bloc. I work 
                    well with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. I love 
                    technology, which is what got me into the idea of coding. Ever 
                    since I have started, I have never looked back and constantly 
                    try to find different ways to make my ideas come to life!</p>
